# 🧩 Django Microservices Architecture

This repository is a modular, production-ready Django microservices architecture designed with scalability, decoupling, and maintainability in mind.

Each microservice runs independently with its own database and Docker container. Services communicate via REST APIs, and shared logic is abstracted in a common library.
